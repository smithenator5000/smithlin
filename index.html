<h2> What is This? </h2>
<strong>smithlin</strong> is a basic but inituive C++ library for linear algebra. It is currently in development by yours truly, <a href="https://smithenator5000.github.io"><strong>Smithenator5000</strong></a>. It aims to support standard linear algebra objects such as matrices and vectors, in a way that is not too disimilar to how one would write it on pape. For example, as opposed to writing matrix product AB as product(A, B) (or worse yet, using a nested 'for' loop), one may write A*B. <hr/>
<h2> What Can It Do? </h2>
It is early days at the moment but already, <strong>smithlin</strong> can: <ul>
<li> Do basic matrix calculations, such as adding and multiplying matrices. </li>
<li> Find matrix determinants with two different methods. </li>
<li> Do basic vector operations such as the dot and cross product. </li>
<li> And a little bit more . . . </li>
</ul> Like I said, it's early days.
